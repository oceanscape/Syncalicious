On macOS, preferences are everything; they are what separate your mac from the rest, make it stand out, and give it personality. Setting up a new installation of macOS can be fun and liberating, but it can also be a chore. This is where Syncalicious comes in. It aims to offer two main features:

- ðŸŒ€ Synchronize
- âœ… Backup

### Synchronize

Keeping multiple macOS preferences in sync can be painful, but it shouldn't be. Settings changed on one machine should be replicated on another, if you choose to do so. Syncalicious offers property list syncing for your macOS applications.

### Backup

You don't have to have a science degree to know that backups are a good thing. Syncalicious offers an easy, straight-forward backup feature that makes copies of your property lists (also known as plist files) and can store them in a directory of your choosing or push them to iCloud, Dropbox, or Google Drive.
